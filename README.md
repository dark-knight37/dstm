# Dynamic STate Machine (DSTM)

The DSTM formalism have been defined by researchers belonging the University of Naples Federico II (Italy) and the University of Campania Region "Luigi Vanvitelli" (Italy).

The formal syntax and semantics of the DSTM formalism, together with technical details have been published in scientific papers, such as:

[1] Benerecetti, Massimo, et al. "Dynamic state machines for modelling railway control systems." Science of Computer Programming 133 (2017): 116-153.

[2] Nardone, Roberto, et al. "Modeling railway control systems in Promela." International Workshop on Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems. Springer, Cham, 2015.

[3] Nardone, Roberto, et al. "Dynamic state machines for formalizing railway control system specifications." International Workshop on Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems. Springer, Cham, 2014.


The main contributor to the definition of the formalism and of the development of the supporting tools are the following:

A special thank goes to all other people that have contributed to the project over time.

This repository contains the source code related to:

1) the textual editor for DSTM formalism
2) the compiler translating a DSTM specification (as generated by the editor) into a Promela program (.pml)
3) some concrete examples (including graphical representation, textual model and obtained Promela file)

The repository is maintained and updated regularly. If you need assistance or if you want to contribute please contact roberto.nardone@unina.it
